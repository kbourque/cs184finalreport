        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            We implemented a 3D particle-based method of fluid simulation that addresses issues from SPH methods such as enforcing incompressibility and energy loss.
             We chose this project because fluid simulation is widely used in animation, and we thought it was going to be an intriguing challenge to implement because 
             of the heavy computation used. We used Macklin and Muller’s paper as a guide for implementing particle constraints, and 
             built off of the cloth simulator project code.

                During each simulation step, we would first build a spatial map to find each particle’s set of neighbors, 
                and apply external forces, then for a number of iterations we would calculate the scaling factor, <b>lambda</b>, and 
                perform a position update with both lambda and the artificial pressure <b>s_corr</b>. Finally, after detecting collisions, 
                we would update our velocity with changed positions and apply vorticity and viscosity for the next iteration.

                <h4>Finding neighbors</h4>
                <p>
                        Many of the next sections calculate position and velocity of a PointMass (particle) based on different aspects of their neighbors. 
                        We found that the optimal number of neighbors for each particle turned out to be around 20-30.
                </p>

                <p>
                        To assign point mass neighbors, we created used a map; the keys were a spatial hash of the point masses based on their x, y and z positions, 
                        and the values were a list of PointMasses that mapped to the same hash. The purpose of this was to divide the volume into sectors and map PointMasses 
                        to sectors so that we didn’t have to consider every particle when checking for neighbors, but only the particles in the same sector.  
                        Each PointMass struct contains a <span class="code">std::vector<PointMass*></span> neighbors that is updated every time step.

                    <h4>Detecting Collisions</h4> 
                    <p>
                        We added collision detection before setting the finalized positions of particles at the end of each step to ensure that no particles traveled through any objects in the scene, 
                        like planes or spheres.  To implement collisions we corrected the predicted position so that if a particle wouldn’t go past the bounds of the collision object plus a constant 
                        <span class="code">SURFACE_OFFSET</span> (this is so the points lay just beside the object and not directly on it to prevent any rendering ambiguity).

            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Enforcing Incompressibility</h4>
                <p>
                        The goal of each simulation step is to predict each particle’s new position based on external forces and density constraints.  
                        The density constraints (there is one non-linear constraint per particle) are solved for over several iterations with Newton’s method.  
                        Once the density constraints, indicated by <span class="code">lambda</span>, are finalized for each particle, they are applied to the calculation of the predicted position.

                <h4>Adding Tensile Instability</h4>
                <p>
                        One problem mentioned in Macklin’s paper that SPH simulations suffer from is clumping from when a neighbor doesn’t have enough neighbors can’t satisfy the rest density.  
                        To combat this we followed the approach in the paper of adding an artificial pressure term, which we call s_corr.  
                        This term is included in the calculation of delta_p, the new position and imitates the effects of surface tension by making particles draw their neighbors towards them.

                            To address the issue of dampening and lost energy from SPH methods of fluid simulation, 
                            we calculate the vorticity of each particle’s location and a corrective force based on that vorticity.

                            We also added viscosity in order to simulate a thicker consistency. We followed the approach in the PBD paper for both of these.

            <h4>Modifications to Cloth Simulator Code</h4>
            <div>
                Aside from understanding and implementing the particle position updates explained in the paper, our other technical challenges included improving demoability, changing particles from points to spheres, and implementing particle stacking.
            </div>

            <h4>Improving Demoability</h4>
            <div>
                Although the cloth simulator also used a system of particles to emulate a physical system, it had many superfluous fields and methods that we didn’t need for simulating fluids, like the notion of “pinned” and the system of springs among other things.  There were also elements we wanted to add to enhance the demo and allow it to better showcase the properties of fluids.  <br><br>

                It wasn’t particularly interesting to watch a single layer of particles fall onto a single plane.  So to improve scope of our demo, we modified the scene-building code to allow for cubes of water to be initialized in a location of our choice.  This increased the flexibility of our demos because we could build one or multiple volumes of water with the dimensions of our choice.  Then, since fluids are special in that they will fill up the volume available to them, we modified our the JSON for our demo scenes to include a box so we could showcase that particular property of fluids.  To do this we needed to fully understand our coordinate system and know what relative planes to define in order to create a cube in the space. 
            </div>
            <div align="center">
                <table style="width=90%; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    <tr>
                        <td align="middle">
                            <img src="img/multiple_waters.png" width="60%" />

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div> 
            <div>
                Finally, to make the particles more visually pleasing and water-like we changed the color of each point mass being rendered, and also varied the color depending on the position of each particle.  
            </div>

            <h4>Parameter Tuning</h4>
            <div>
                Many of the problems we dealt with had to do with poorly chosen parameters. These parameters included mass of the particles, kernel radius (h), neighbor radius, and the pressure scalar (k). We conducted many different informal empirical tests to determine the correct choices for a lot of these, but luckily also found some parameters that Miles Macklin recommended himself. The change in parameters was pretty significant -- they solved problems such as particles just never falling down or repelling each other too much.

            <h4>Changing Particles from Points to Spheres</h4>
            <div>
                What we thought would be a simple task was actually quite frustratingly not as straightforward. We initially tried to continue to use GL_POINTS by enabling smoothing using the command “glEnable(GL_POINT_SMOOTH);” and enable blending, but we were unable to compile because the identifier “GL_POINT_SMOOTH” couldn’t be found. The same thing happened when we tried to use point sprites which would allow us to apply spherical textures on the points. <br><br>

                Through some fun Googling we learned that different versions of OpenGL on different hardware support different functions. <br><br>

                We then tried to use GLUT/GLU libraries’ draw sphere functions. Adding this library gave us the opportunity to understand Cmake better as we had to figure out how to add the library and link them to our executable. Unfortunately, using the function “glutSolidSphere(GLdouble radius, GLint slices, GLint stacks);” let to an error we were unable to debug “Error 00000502 after convex fill”.  <br><br>

                At this point, another team member tried using the drawSphere function in the cloth simulation code itself, and that worked! Always nice to have multiple brains working on the job. <br><br>

        <h3>Complexity Analysis:</h3>


After running our simulation many, many times, it was quite clear that it worked much faster for a smaller number of particles, but we decided we needed to figure out exactly how much. We started with a 5 x 5 x 5 particle cube and made our way up to a 20 x 20 x 20 particle cube, increasing each dimension by 1 unit at a time. Our results are represented in the graph and table below:<br><br>

        <h2>Overall</h2>
        Overall, although we didn’t get our fluid simulation looking exactly how we wanted and definitely started with very optimistic and lofty expectations, this project was a great learning experience.<br><br>

Not many classes we’ve taken require us to complete an open-ended project, and for a project as daunting-sounding as fluid simulation, it’s nice to be forced to complete it in a group and with the knowledge that course staff is available to us for any help we need. We left with a renewed appreciation for the scope of open-ended projects.<br><br>

Realizing when we had to use interesting techniques like dynamic programming was a nice nod to previous classes we’ve taken that may have been more theory-based.<br><br>

We’d also never read and implemented a paper before so it was a unique experience and we got to see that even though the paper laid out a lot of the details for us and made it seem quite straightforward, it wasn’t necessarily that way.<br><br>

And of course, it was nice working with a group of patient, intelligent and hard-working peers! We shared many a laugh.<br><br>
